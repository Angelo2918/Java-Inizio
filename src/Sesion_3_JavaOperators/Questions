I.What is a Stack and a Queue? Ho do they work and when are used?
Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
 Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to
  the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.




II.What is the difference between for and for enhanced? When I should use one or another?
Use the traditional for loop when you need explicit control over the iteration, need to modify the elements, or do not iterate over an array or collection.
Use the enhanced for loop for simplicity and readability when you simply need to access each element of an array or collection without modifying them.
